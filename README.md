## Final Project II

### Development Log:

**Weekend (5/18 - 5/19):** 
*Experimenting with different ways of creating planets when clicking the mouse. Also trying to figure out how to determine the elliptical orbit of a planet around the sun given the sun as a focus and planet as a vertex.*

**Monday 5/20:** 
*Continued working on figuring out how to determine the center of the elliptical orbit. We decided to start with planets in our solar system (because then we can predetermine the eccentricity of the elliptical orbit).*

**Tuesday 5/21:**
*Created a visual interface for choosing planets, without actually creating the planets.*

**Wednesday 5/22:** 
*Worked on equation of motion, which is circular rather than elliptical. Integrated interface in with actual functions. Drew a grid for testing purposes.*

**Friday 5/24:**
*Fixed issues with elliptical orbit. Decided to make a collideable function for when planets collide with the sun, tried to figure out how to fix bug of planets not going to the right place.*

**Weekend 5/25 - 5/27:**
*We updated the orbital motion of the planets to take into account their mass/size and starting position relative to the sun. We also added a menu screen and worked to debug several issues: mode not changing to "CHOSEN" in the planet simulation and the features that go with this mode not showing up, and the issue where the planets moved with multiple copies instead of just one planet orbiting the sun.*

**Tuesday 5/28:**


**Wednesday 5/29:**


**Thursday 5/30:**
*We fixed the issue in the planetary orbit simulation where planets jumped to the wrong coordinates when placed. We also started working more on the projectile motion model by setting up the correct parametric equations for move() and creating a basic template for display().*
