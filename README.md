Final Project II


Development Log:

Weekend (5/18 - 5/19): Experimenting with different ways of creating planets when clicking the mouse. Also trying to figure out how to determine the elliptical orbit of a planet around the sun given the sun as a focus and planet as a vertex.

Monday 5/20: Continued working on figuring out how to determine the center of the elliptical orbit. We decided to start with planets in our solar system (because then we can predetermine the eccentricity of the elliptical orbit).
