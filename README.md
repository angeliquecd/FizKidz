### Development Log:

**Weekend (5/18 - 5/19):**
*Experimenting with different ways of creating planets when clicking the mouse. Also trying to figure out how to determine the elliptical orbit of a planet around the sun given the sun as a focus and planet as a vertex.*

**Monday 5/20:**
*Continued working on figuring out how to determine the center of the elliptical orbit. We decided to start with planets in our solar system (because then we can predetermine the eccentricity of the elliptical orbit).*

**Tuesday 5/21:**
*Created a visual interface for choosing planets, without actually creating the planets.*

**Wednesday 5/22:**
*Worked on equation of motion, which is circular rather than elliptical. Integrated interface in with actual functions. Drew a grid for testing purposes.*

**Friday 5/24:**
*Fixed issues with elliptical orbit. Decided to make a collideable function for when planets collide with the sun, tried to figure out how to fix bug of planets not going to the right place.*

**Weekend 5/25 - 5/27:**
* Angelique: *Worked on the different modes that determine what functions are accessible by user. Also started working on the projectile class with variables, constructor, etc. and made modes for projectile class.*
* Aditi: *Updated the orbital motion of the planets to depend on size and starting position relative to sun. Also added a menu screen and debugged planet motion. Made a simmode to keep track of which simulation the user is interacting with.*

**Tuesday 5/28:**
* Angelique: *Worked on different methods in the projectile class. Spent time on figuring out the math for making projectiles move.*
* Aditi: *Sick :(*

**Wednesday 5/29:**
* Angelique: *Edited the modes to include a projectile mode that was more fleshed out and started to work on math for projectiles. Also edited existing planets so that their size matched their relative size in space.*
* Aditi: *Added a "MENU" button in projectile and planet simulations so user can return to menu screen.*

**Thursday 5/30:**
* Angelique: *Made it so that every planet in the planet simulation would have the proper corresponding color and the make-your-own had a randomly assigned color.*
* Aditi: *Fixed the issue in the planetary orbit where planets jumped to the wrong coordinates when placed. Also started working more on the projectile motion model by setting up the correct parametric equations for move() and creating a basic template for display().*

**Friday 5/31:**
* Angelique: *Worked on the background colors of the solar system (changed to black to look like outer space) and changing the button colors, while fixing merging errors. Also fixed planet sizing and tested the program on a school computer.*
* Aditi: *Continued to fix the math of the projectile on paper and in the code.* 

**Weekend 6/1 - 6/4:**
* Angelique: *Worked on making the selection of variable values easier by adding sliders for eccentricity, radius, velocity, and angle. Also debugged an issue with the random color generation for custom planet selections.*
* Aditi: *Debugged projectile motion so that velocity and angle updated immediately and so that the projectile moved in the proper parabolic motion. Also updated the menu screen and other text messages.*
