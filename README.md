Final Project II


Development Log:

Weekend (5/18 - 5/19): Experimenting with different ways of creating planets when clicking the mouse. Also trying to figure out how to determine the elliptical orbit of a planet around the sun given the sun as a focus and planet as a vertex.

Monday 5/20: Continued working on figuring out how to determine the center of the elliptical orbit. We decided to start with planets in our solar system (because then we can predetermine the eccentricity of the elliptical orbit).

Tuesday 5/21: Created a visual interface for choosing planets, without actually creating the planets

Wednesday 5/22: Worked on equation of motion, which is circular rather than elliptical. Integrated interface in with actual functions. Drew a grid for testing purposes.

Friday 4/24: Fixed issues with elliptical orbit. Decided to make a collidable function for when planets collide with the sun, tried to figure out how to fix bug of planets not going to the right place.
